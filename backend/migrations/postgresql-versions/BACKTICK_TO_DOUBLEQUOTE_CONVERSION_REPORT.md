# PostgreSQL Migration Files: Backtick to Double Quote Conversion Report

## Summary

All backticks (`) have been successfully converted to double quotes (") in PostgreSQL migration files to ensure proper identifier quoting according to PostgreSQL standards.

## Conversion Date
2025-07-04

## Files Modified

### 1. 200016_create_alert_settings.up.postgresql.sql
- **Changes**: 
  - Table name: `alert_settings` → "alert_settings"
  - All column names converted (23 columns)
  - Index names converted (4 indexes)
  - Constraint names converted (2 foreign key constraints)
  - INSERT statement table and column references converted

### 2. 200016_create_alert_settings.down.postgresql.sql
- **Changes**: 
  - Table name in DROP statement: `alert_settings` → "alert_settings"

### 3. 200017_create_alert_histories.up.postgresql.sql
- **Changes**: 
  - Table name: `alert_histories` → "alert_histories"
  - All column names converted (18 columns)
  - Index names converted (9 indexes)
  - Constraint names converted (4 foreign key constraints)
  - Foreign key reference tables converted

### 4. 200017_create_alert_histories.down.postgresql.sql
- **Changes**: 
  - Table name in DROP statement: `alert_histories` → "alert_histories"

## Verification

- Total files in postgresql-versions directory: 116
- Files containing backticks before conversion: 4
- Files containing backticks after conversion: 0
- Conversion success rate: 100%

## Notes

- The conversion maintains the exact same structure and functionality
- All identifiers (tables, columns, indexes, constraints) now use PostgreSQL-standard double quotes
- This is particularly important for:
  - Reserved words that might be used as identifiers
  - Case-sensitive identifier names
  - Consistency with PostgreSQL best practices

## Technical Details

The conversion was performed using automated search and replace operations, ensuring:
- All opening backticks (`) were replaced with opening double quotes (")
- All closing backticks (`) were replaced with closing double quotes (")
- The conversion was applied to:
  - Table names
  - Column names
  - Index names
  - Constraint names
  - References in foreign key definitions
  - Table and column references in DML statements (INSERT, etc.)

## Post-Conversion Recommendations

1. Test all migrations in a PostgreSQL development environment
2. Verify that all foreign key references are correctly resolved
3. Check that any case-sensitive identifiers are handled properly
4. Ensure that reserved words (if any) are properly quoted
